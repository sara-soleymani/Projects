	/* 
	 * Programming Requirements:
	 * 
	 * 	- You are only allowed to use primitive arrays (e.g., int[], String[], Product[]) 
	 * 		for declaring attributes and implementing the idea of collections.
	 * 	- Any use of a Java library class or method is forbidden 
	 * 		(that is, use selections and loops to build your solution from scratch instead):
	 * 	- Here are some examples of forbidden classes/methods: 
	 * 		- Arrays class (e.g., Arrays.copyOf)
	 * 		- System class (e.g., System.arrayCopy)
	 * 		- ArrayList class
	 * 		- String class (e.g., substring).
	 * 	- The use of some library classes does not require an import statement, 
	 * 		but these classes are also forbidden to be used.
	 * 	- Here are the exceptions (library methods which you are allowed to use if needed):
	 * 		- String class (equals, format)
	 * 
	 * Violating the above programming requirements will result in a penalty (see lab instructions for details). 
	 * 
	 * Tests included in this class serve as documentation on how instances of an Apple AppStore operates.
	 * 
	 * Before attempting this lab, it is expected that you already completed background study materials:
	 * 	1. Review Tutorial Series on OOP in Java (Part 1 and Part 2): 
	 * 		https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~jackie/teaching/tutorials/index.html#refurbished_store
	 * 	2. Written Notes on Reference-Typed, Multi-Valued Attributes:
	 * 		https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~jackie/teaching/lectures/2021/F/EECS2030/notes/EECS2030_F21_Tracing_PointCollectorTester.pdf
	 * 	3. Written Notes on Inferring Classes from JUnit Tests:
	 * 		https://www.eecs.yorku.ca/~jackie/teaching/lectures/2021/F/EECS2030/notes/EECS2030_F21_Inferring_Classes_from_JUnit.pdf 
	 * 
	 * Be sure to also read the following sections from your Lab1 instructions PDF:
	 * 	- The `Requirements of this Lab` section (page 3) 
	 * 	- Section 2.3 The Building Design Problem
	 * 	- Section 2.4 Hints and Requirements
	 * 
	 * Programming IDEs such as Eclipse are able to fix some compilation errors for you. 
	 * However, you are advised to follow the guidance as specified in the written notes above
	 * to fix these compilation errors manually, because: 
	 * 	1) it helps you better understand how the intended classes and methods work together; and 
	 * 	2) you may be tested in a written test or exam without the assistance of IDEs.
