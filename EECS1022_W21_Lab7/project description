 an object-oriented program solving the problem of a (simplified) bank, which provides
services (i.e., deposit, withdraw, transfer, and print statement) to a collection of up to 6 clients (i.e., when a 7th
client is attempted to be added to the bank, there should be an error message displayed). Each client can be
characterized by their name, numerical balance (always displayed with two digits after the decimal point), and a
history (i.e., collection) of up to 10 transactions (for this you can assume that the user will not complete more than
10 transactions for each client). Each client should be identified by their name. We may want to perform one of
the following kinds of transactions:
• Deposit some input amount of money to a client’s account (identified by their name).
• Withdraw some input amount of money from a client’s account (identified by their name).
• Transfer some input amount of money from a client’s account to another client’s account (identified by their
names).
